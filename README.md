## PowerShell based Bulk Download File scripts
I wrote this to partially automate the download of pdf files from a website.  It uses regex to parse the site and place the download links in a text files for review.  The second script reads the filenames from the specified text file, creates a folder structure to hold them, and downloads the files.
